Problem Definition
The objective is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters. This is a binary classification problem where:

1 indicates the presence of heart disease.
0 indicates its absence.

Key Question:
Can clinical parameters predict the presence of heart disease?

Dataset
The dataset originates from the Cleveland Heart Disease Database, accessed via Kaggle in a preprocessed form.

Features
The dataset contains 14 features, including:

Age: Patient's age in years.
Sex: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female).
Chest Pain Type (cp): Type of chest pain experienced (e.g., typical angina, asymptomatic).
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Measured in mm Hg.
Cholesterol (chol): Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
Target: 1 = Heart disease, 0 = No heart disease.
Refer to the notebook for a complete Data Dictionary.

Project Workflow
This project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into the dataset, trends, and relationships.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalization.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting the most predictive features.
4. Model Training: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, etc.
5. Model Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.
6. Model Comparison and Tuning: Hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV.
7. Visualization: Visual insights into data trends and model performance.
